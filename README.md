Welcome to the Chat App repository! This project is a simple real-time chat application built using React.js for the frontend, Express.js for the server, and Socket.IO for enabling real-time communication between clients. To get started, clone the repository and navigate to the chat-app directory. Run npm install to install the necessary dependencies for the server, including Express and Socket.IO. Then, navigate to the client directory and run npm install again to install React.js dependencies. Once everything is installed, start the development server by running npm run dev in the chat-app directory and npm start in the client directory simultaneously.
